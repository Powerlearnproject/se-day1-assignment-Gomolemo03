#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles and techniques to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems. It is important in the technology industry because it drives innovation, ensures quality and realibilty, supports economic growth and improves safety and security.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milestone 1: The NATO Software Engineering Conference(1968)- this conference marked birth of software engineering as a distinct field, it brought together experts to discuss the challenges of software development and the need for a more systematic approach
Milestone2: The Development of the Waterfall Model- it introduced a linear, phase-by-phase approach to software development, emphasizing planning, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.
Milestone 3: The Agile Manifesto- it emphasized values such as individual interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a) Planning Phase- define project scope, goals and deliverables. Develop a project plan and schedule.
b) Requirements Gathering Phase- collect and document software requirements from stakeholders and users. Define functional and non-functional requirements.
c) Design Phase- create a detailed design of the software architecture, develop a user interface and user experience design.
d) Implementation Phase- write the software code based on the desogn specifications, develop software components, modules and features.
e) Testing Phase- conduct thorough testing of the software, including: functional testing, performance testing, security testing and usability testing. Identify and fix defects.
f) Deployment Phase- plan and execute the deployment of the software, set up the production environment, conduct final testing.
g) Maintenance Phase- monitor software performance and fix issues,gather feedback from users and stakeholders, continuously evaluate and improve software quality.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology
Linear and sequential: phases are completed one after the other, with no overlap.
Predictive: Requirements are gathered upfront, and the project plan is created accordingly.
Change-resistant: Changes to requirements are difficult and costly to implement.
Scenarios of Waterfall: safety- critical systems where requirements are well defined, and changes can be costly or even dangerous( e.g aerospace, medical devices)
Agile Methodology
Iterative and incremental: Work is divided into small chunks, and phases are repeated in cycles
Adaptive: Requirements are gathered and refined throughout the project
Change-friendly: Changes to requirements are accommodated through regular iterations.
Scenarios of Agile: innovative or uncertain projects where requirements are unclear or evolving( e.g startups, research and development)

2. Version Control Systems (VCS)  
Importance:  
VCS helps developers track changes, collaborate efficiently, and maintain different versions of a project. It prevents code conflicts, enables rollback to previous versions, and supports team-based development.  
Examples:  
- Git – A widely used distributed VCS, often paired with repositories like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.  
- Apache Subversion (SVN) – A centralized version control system used in some enterprise environments.  
- Mercurial – Another distributed VCS, similar to Git, but with a simpler design.
